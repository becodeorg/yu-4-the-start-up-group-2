                <h3>The Servants</h3>
                <p>Here we see one of 'the servants'. We created this creature to use in a film called The Servants. 
                  This rodent has a pretty dark life as he lives as a slave.<br> <br> 
                On this project we came across multiple hurdles, wich challenged us a lot. 
              But at the end of the day we are really happy how it turned out to be.</p></div>

            <h3>Pulsério The Analist</h3>
            <p>This little guy was created to implement in a game. The game itself takes place on a planet Niburu.
               This alien like creature is from a race called the chamachies.<br> <br>
               Pulsério is someone u will meet later on in this story and will help you progress further in the game.

            <h3>A Day At The Races</h3>
            <p>So we decided to go for an oldtimer to use for an advertisement for Mercedes-Benz. When we had the modeling and texture done I was looking for a story 
            and wondered if there were any women driving those deadly machines back in the 1930's, and yes there were and more than one. <br> <br>But one of the most famous was Helle Nice who became champion in the mixed formula 1 competition. Altough she drove for other brands 
            we wanted to pay a small tribute to all those female drivers competing in a mixed competition. So we created a scene, 
            like it would be at the time, when the race Paris-Madrid passes a small rural village.</p></div>
