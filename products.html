      <h3>The Servants</h3>
      <p>Here we see one of 'the servants'. We created this creature to use in a film called The Servants.
        This rodent has a pretty dark life as he lives as a slave.<br> <br>
        On this project we came across multiple hurdles, wich challenged us a lot.
        But at the end of the day we are really happy how it turned out to be.</p>

      <h3>A Day At The Races</h3>
      <p>So we decided to go for an oldtimer to use for an advertisement for Mercedes-Benz. When we had the modeling and
        texture done I was looking for a story
        and wondered if there were any women driving those deadly machines back in the 1930's, and yes there were and
        more than one. <br> <br>But one of the most famous was Helle Nice who became champion in the mixed formula 1
        competition. Altough she drove for other brands
        we wanted to pay a small tribute to all those female drivers competing in a mixed competition. So we created a
        scene,
        like it would be at the time, when the race Paris-Madrid passes a small rural village.</p>
